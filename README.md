Rust rewrite of a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC Python program

This is just a simple rewrite of a previous Python program of mine to get familiar with Rust.
You probably don't want to use this, especially because 2D Metropolis-Hastings isn't useful in practice, only to learn.
If you've somehow ended up here looking for a multi-dimensional Metropolis sampler in Rust, take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/ManifoldFR/rust-metropolis).

Some of very succint thoughts on Rust compared to C++ and Python:
- Way better than C++, I will never debug a seg fault again.
- Way faster than Python.
- Charts suck, not nearly as cool as Python and matplotlib for data viz.
- I like it.
